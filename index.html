        RPS - Drawing Game (With Strategic Decision)

        In RPS - Drawing Game each object in the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game will be represented by a symbol. Rock will be represented by a circle, Paper by a square, and Scissors by an “X”.
        2 Players.

        Round 1: Once the players say “Rock, Paper, Scissors shoot” each player will draw 7 symbols in a line, these will be played out in seven short “clashes” (Figure 1). Once the drawing of seven symbols is complete the players will battle it out in the sequence in which each symbol was drawn. Whoever wins most of these clashes wins the round (Figure 2). If both win the same amount, there is no winner of Round 1. If a player loses all seven clashes, they automatically lose the game.

        Round 2: The end of Round 1 will determine a “Champion” based on the “survivors” of the seven drawn symbols. The majority symbol of the survivors will be your Champion, or in case of equal amounts of survivor symbols, it will be the first in the sequential order. For example, if a player has won three of the 7 “clashes” and these surviving (or victorious) symbols are 1 circle and two squares, the “champion” will be a square. Round 2 merely pits both champions against each other (Figure 3).

        Round 3 (Tie-breaker): If both players each win a round they meet in a tie-breaker round. Each player will try to guess what their opponent will choose in a short round of classic RPS by writing it down. If correctly guessed that player will be the winner. If no one guesses or both guess correctly, this quick tie breaker continues until one of the players is victorious (Figure 4).

        Figures: (Both players’ drawings are shown together here for convenience, but they should be separate when playing the game)

        Strategic Decision:
        An element of strategic skill that can be used for RPS is a tradeoff. In RPS, a player can opt out of the 7 clashes and instead create a “quick” champion out of the symbols (sort of like a Mecha) for the next round with only 2 symbols instead of 3. The advantage is a 1 creativity point which will be added to the first round score. The disadvantage is you can only use 2 instead of the 3 symbols allotted.
        For strategy, a player could identify and anticipate what their opponent will choose. Statistically, playing scissors first is a great strategic move since it wins most often according to psychology. If your opponent played scissors, chances are your opponent will play scissors again. Anticipate your opponents moves and play rock to crush scissors. Rock is also chosen predominantly by males. With these statistics you could “risk” it by following these rules. “Mirroring” your opponent is also another option. Play what your opponent just played in the same sequence. They may flip what they have already played.

          “Run for your life” Game
          Leaving the home you grew up in that has been ravaged by war is incredibly difficult. Much more difficult than most people can imagine. Where do you go? What do you take with you? Who can you trust? This game will seek to metaphorically answer these tough questions. This is a game about the journey of a refugee.
          Items

		●  1 Pack Resource Cards (28 Cards) 
		●  4 Red “Checker” chips and 1 Black “Checker” chips 
		●  1 Pair of Dice 
		●  Dominoes Rules
		●  (1-3) Players 
		●  To Begin, the oldest player will pick place the double six as the first chip. 
		●  Now, roll 1 die to determine what you will pick up. You will have the option to pick up cards or dominos. 
		●  The player has free will to choose to build a path or pick up resources. You may work with other players to see what the best options are.
		●  The dice roll will be your move and the next will be your “action.” 
		●  Dominos (The Path)
		●  Match the dominos with the corresponding number that you rolled. 
		●  You can complete only 1 action per turn. 
		●  If a domino doesn’t match you will keep it to use in a later round but you may not have more than 7. 
		●  You will pick up the amount that is on the dice rolled. 
		●  Blank dominos = Wild Card 
		●  Penalties 

        ■ You can only “rotate” or change directions with dominos when you roll a “checkpoint” chip (see
        Checkpoints/Border Patrol ).

		●  Resource Cards
		●  There are 28 Resource Cards in a deck. 
		●  You can complete only 1 action per turn. So, if you draw cards one round you can only use 1 card to move within your turn.
		●  You can only have 7 resource cards in your hand at a time. 
		●  Spend your resource cards that match the number on the domino to move forward. 
		●  Aces are 1’s and blanks are wild cards. 
		●  Checkpoints/Border Patrol
		●  A “checkpoint” chip will be obtained if a 1 or 2 is rolled. However, this will change as the player progresses the map if the the “Border Patrol” is activated.
		●  Once 3 checkpoints are placed the “Border Patrol” becomes activated! Now, you are being followed. The roll rules will now reset. Once a checkpoint is passed on the map the amount will go up by 1. Example: If border patrol passes the first checkpoint the amount is 1-3, if they passed the second checkpoint the amount is 1-4, etc. Win-State-Lose-State 
        ● Travel through the road you have constructed and reach the end without getting caught by the “border police” (red checker). If you are caught you lose the game.

        This game doesn’t take itself too seriously since I made it at 3AM. Rules are just play through the novel, click some buttons, and enjoy the stupidity.

        Like most people I hated Game of thrones season 8. This was a cute attempt to go back in time and change the parts I didn’t like. I could only make it though Battle of Winterfell but It was truly healing. Play as Daenerys(forgive her) accompanied by Jon and meet up with characters along the way! Winter is COMING.
